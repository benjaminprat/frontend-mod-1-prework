## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a collection of data. In this sense it is like an array. An array only outputs an ordered list. You can perform more complex operations
with an object.

1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`var petStore = {
  treats: 20,
  leashes: 15,
  toys: 25,
  pee pads: 10
};`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`states.IA`

1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?

`states.MN = "Minnesota"`

1. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

We might use an object when we are working with a lot data and need to perform more dynamic/complex tasks?

1. What questions do you still have about objects?

Much like everything else, I'll need to go back and practice and study more about objects until it becomes muscle memory in terms of being able to work with them.

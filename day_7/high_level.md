Caesar Cipher

To begin solving this I will note that I am keeping the shift of 3 provided in
the example. I plan to use a for loop to tackle this problem.

First I would start a variable called alphabet and store an array strings- e.g.
`var alphabet = ["A", "B"]`

At some point these will need to be lowercased. I know we should use
the charCode function at some point. To be honest, the last two days of the prework
gave me so much trouble I really had nothing left in the brain tank to deliver
quality work for this exercise. To be honest I was looking at different solutions
to see if it would jog anything for me but I'm really at a loss about how to tackle this problem.
I think this is supposed to be a pseudocode?
